Find your dreams come true

And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means to find your dreams

I've been waitin' on

this my whole life

These dreams be wakin'

me up at night

You say I think I'm never wrong
